## Install

```sh
npm i -D wireit
```

## Setup

Wireit works _with_ `npm run`, it doesn't replace it. To configure an NPM script
for Wireit, move the command into a new `wireit` section of your `package.json`,
and replace the original script with the `wireit` command.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Before</th>
<th>After</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre lang="json">
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc"
  }
}
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre lang="json">
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "wireit"
  },
  "wireit": {
    "build": {
      "command": "tsc"
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Now when you run `npm run build`, Wireit upgrades the script to be smarter and
more efficient.

You should also add `.wireit` to your `.gitignore` file. Wireit uses the
`.wireit` directory to store caches and other data for your scripts.

```sh
echo .wireit >> .gitignore
```

## Dependencies

To declare a dependency between two scripts, edit the
`wireit.<script>.dependencies` list:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "wireit",
    "bundle": "wireit"
  },
  "wireit": {
    "build": {
      "command": "tsc"
    },
    "bundle": {
      "command": "rollup -c",
      "dependencies": ["build"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now when you run `npm run bundle`, the `build` script will automatically run
first.

### Vanilla scripts

The scripts you depend on don't need to be configured for Wireit, they can be
vanilla `npm` scripts. This lets you only use Wireit for some of your scripts,
or to upgrade incrementally. Scripts that haven't been configured for Wireit are
always safe to use as dependencies; they just won't be fully optimized.

### Cross-package dependencies

Dependencies can refer to scripts in other npm packages by using a relative path
with the syntax `<relative-path>:<script-name>`. All cross-package dependencies
should start with a `"."`. Cross-package dependencies work well for npm
workspaces, as well as in other kinds of monorepos.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "wireit"
  },
  "wireit": {
    "build": {
      "command": "tsc",
      "dependencies": ["../other-package:build"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Incremental build

Wireit can automatically skip execution of a script if nothing has changed that
would cause it to produce different output since the last time it ran. This is
called _incremental build_. When a script is skipped, any `stdout` or `stderr`
that it produced in the previous run is replayed.

To enable incremental build, configure the input files for each script by
specifying [glob patterns](#glob-patterns) in the `wireit.<script>.files` list:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "wireit",
    "bundle": "wireit"
  },
  "wireit": {
    "build": {
      "command": "tsc",
      "files": ["src/**/*.ts", "tsconfig.json"]
    },
    "bundle": {
      "command": "rollup -c",
      "dependencies": ["build"],
      "files": ["rollup.config.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now when you run `npm run bundle`:

- The `tsc` command is skipped if no changes are detected in the `.ts` or
  `tsconfig.json` files.
- The `rollup` command is skipped if no changes are detected in the
  `rollup.config.json` file, and if no changes were detected in the input files
  to `tsc`.

Notes:

- If a script doesn't have a `files` list defined at all, then it will _always_
  run, because Wireit doesn't know which files to check for changes. To tell
  Wireit it is safe to skip execution of a script that definitely has no input
  files, set `files` to an empty array (`files: []`).

- In addition to the `files` list, the following also determine whether a script
  will be skipped or not:
  - The `command` must not have changed.
  - The `files` of all transitive dependencies must not have changed.
  - All transitive dependencies must have `files` defined (can be empty).

## Caching

If a script has previously succeeded with the same configuration and input
files, then Wireit can copy the output from a cache, instead of running the
command.

To enable caching, configure the output files for each script by specifying
[glob patterns](#glob-patterns) in the `wireit.<script>.output` list:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "wireit",
    "bundle": "wireit"
  },
  "wireit": {
    "build": {
      "command": "tsc",
      "files": ["src/**/*.ts", "tsconfig.json"],
      "output": ["lib/**"]
    },
    "bundle": {
      "command": "rollup -c",
      "dependencies": ["build"],
      "files": ["rollup.config.json"],
      "output": ["dist/bundle.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- In order to be cached, both a `files` array _and_ an `output` array must be
  defined. See [incremental build](#incremental-build) for details about the
  `files` array.

- If a script doesn't have a `output` list defined at all, then it will never be
  cached, because Wireit doesn't know which files to save to the cache. To tell
  Wireit it is safe to store a cache entry even when there are no output files,
  set `output` to an empty array (`array: []`). An empty `output` array is
  especially useful for tests.

## Cleaning output

Wireit can automatically delete output files from previous runs before executing
a script. This is helpful for ensuring that every build is clean and free from
outdated files created in previous runs from source files that have since been
removed.

To enable output cleaning, configure the output files for each script by
specifying the `wireit.<script>.output` array (see [caching](#caching) for
example).

To disable this behavior, set `<script>.clean` to `false`. You should only
disable cleaning if you are certain that the script itself already takes care of
removing outdated files from previous runs.

## Watch mode

In _watch_ mode, Wireit monitors all `files` of a script, and all `files` of its
transitive dependencies, and when there is a change, it re-runs only the
affected scripts. To enable watch mode, add the `watch` argument:

```sh
npm run <script> watch
```

The benefit of Wireit's watch mode over built-in watch modes are:

- Wireit watches the entire dependency graph, so a single watch command replaces
  many built-in ones.
- It prevents problems that can occur when running many separate watch commands
  simultaneously, such as build steps being triggered before all preceding steps
  have finished.

## Package locks

By default, Wireit automatically treats
[`package-lock.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-lock-json)
files in the package directory, plus all parent directories, as input files.
This is useful because installing or upgrading your dependencies can affect the
behavior of your scripts, so it's important to re-run them whenever your
dependencies change.

If you are using an alternative package manager instead of npm, then your
package lock files might be named something else. Some examples are:

- Yarn: [`yarn.lock`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#lockfileFilename) (configurable)
- pnpm: [`pnpm-lock.yaml`](https://pnpm.io/git#lockfiles)

To change the name of the package lock files Wireit should look for, specify it
in the `wireit.<script>.packageLocks` array. Wireit will look for the given
filenames in the script's directory, as well as in all of its parent
directories. You can specify multiple filenames here, if needed.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "wireit"
  },
  "wireit": {
    "build": {
      "command": "tsc",
      "files": ["src/**/*.ts", "tsconfig.json"],
      "output": ["lib/**"],
      "packageLocks": ["yarn.lock"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you're sure that a script isn't affected by dependencies at all, you can turn
off this behavior entirely to improve your cache hit rate by setting
`wireit.<script>.packageLocks` to `[]`.

## Reference

### Configuration

The following properties can be set inside `wireit.<script>` objects in
`package.json` files:

| Example        | Type       | Default                 | Description                                                                                                 |

| `files`        | `string[]` | `undefined`             | Input file [glob patterns](#glob-patterns), used to determine the [cache key](#cache-key).                  |
| `output`       | `string[]` | `undefined`             | Output file [glob patterns](#glob-patterns), used for [caching](#caching) and [cleaning](#cleaning-output). |
| `clean`        | `boolean`  | `true`                  | [Delete output files before running](#cleaning-output).                                                     |
| `packageLocks` | `string[]` | `['package-lock.json']` | [Names of package lock files](#package-locks).                                                              |

### Dependency syntax

The following syntaxes can be used in the `wireit.<script>.dependencies` array:

| Example      | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `foo`        | Script named `"foo"` in the same package.                                                       |
| `../foo:bar` | Script named `"bar"` in the package found at `../foo` ([details](#cross-package-dependencies)). |

### Glob patterns

The following glob syntaxes are supported in the `files` and `output` arrays:

| Example         | Description                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `foo`           | The file named `foo`.                                                          |
| `foo/*`         | All files directly in the `foo/` directory.                                    |
| `foo/**/*`      | All files in the `foo/` directory, and in any of its recursive subdirectories. |
| `foo.{html,js}` | Files named `foo.html` or `foo.js`.                                            |
| `!foo`          | Exclude the file `foo` from previous matches.                                  |

Also note these details:

- Hidden/dot files are matched by `*` and `**`.
- Patterns are case-sensitive (if supported by the filesystem).

### Cache key

The following inputs determine the _cache key_ for a script. This key is used to
determine whether a script can be skipped for [incremental
build](#incremental-build), and whether its output can be [restored from
cache](#caching).

- The `command` setting.
- The `clean` setting.
- The `output` glob patterns.
- The SHA256 content hashes of all files matching `files`.
- The SHA256 content hashes of all files matching `packageLocks` in the current
  package and all parent directories.
- The cache key of all transitive dependencies.

## Requirements

Wireit is supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Wireit requires Node Active LTS (16) or Current (17). Node Maintenance LTS
releases are not supported. See [here](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)
for Node's release schedule.
